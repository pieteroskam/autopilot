## Installation Guide
To set up the code and motor driver, I created a short video tutorial:  
üëâ https://youtu.be/zypO15Sglec  

The complete firmware (including built-in compass, NMEA, clutch, and other features) is delivered via an **OTA update** from the phone app to the ESP32.  

For a full assembly guide covering all components (including internal compass, wireless remote, and NMEA), go to:

## Autopilot ‚Äì ESP32 BLE
This code can be flashed to an ESP32 using the **Arduino SDK**.  

It can run as a **standalone autopilot based on compass steering**, or you can use it with the phone app:  
- [Android](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.sailtactical.autopilot)  
- [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/nl/app/nautinect-autopilot/id6473739289)  

When using the app, the **compass, gyro, and GPS of your phone** will be used.  
In that case, you only need an **ESP32** and a **motor driver**.  

- Wire the motor driver to the ESP32.  
- Connect **VCC** and **GND** as described in the documentation.  
- Connect **GPIO 33** ‚Üí motor-driver-left.  
- Connect **GPIO 32** ‚Üí motor-driver-right.

## ESP32 Driver
If your computer does not recognize the ESP32 when you plug it in, install the **CP210x driver**:

## Installation Methods

### 1. Web Flasher (EASY)  
üëâ [http://nautinect.com/firmware-flasher](http://nautinect.com/firmware-flasher)  

### 2. Arduino SDK V2 (ADVANCED)
1. Download and install [Arduino IDE V2](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)  
2. Go to **Tools ‚Üí Board Manager**, search for `esp32`, and install **ESP32 by Espressif Systems**.  
3. Create a folder named `autopilot_basic`.  
   - Copy all `.ino`, `.cpp`, and `.h` files from the repository into this folder.  
   - Open `autopilot_ble.ino` with the Arduino IDE.  
4. Select your board (e.g., **DEVKIT ESP32**) and COM port.  
   - If the ESP boards do not appear, make sure you added ESP32 support to the Arduino IDE.  

Now open the app on your phone. It will search for a Bluetooth device named **autopilot**.  
When found, connect to it.

## Hardware
1. **ESP32** ‚Äì preferably a USB-C type with 30 pins (CH340C).  
2. **Motor driver** ‚Äì IBT-2 (max 40A) or L298N (max 2A).  
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Many clones exist, and behavior may differ.  
   - The +5V output is not always available.  
   - Faulty drivers are common ‚Üí order at least 2.  
3. Jumper wires.  
4. **5V supply** for ESP32 (options):  
   - Powerbank  
   - USB socket  
   - +5V from L298N  
   - Voltage regulator (step down 12V/24V ‚Üí 5V)  
   - Phone with USB OTG cable  
   - ESP32 expansion board (rated up to 16V)
